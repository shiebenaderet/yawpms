<h2>The Short Answer: Nobody (Yet)</h2>

<p>Right now, American Yawp MS is a passion project created and maintained by a history educator in their spare time. No grants, no corporate sponsors, no advertising. Just someone who believes that high-quality history education should be free for everyone.</p>

<p>That means the project runs on donated time and energy.</p>

<h2>Why Free Matters</h2>

<p>Traditional textbooks can cost schools $50–$150 per student. For a class of 30 students, that's $1,500–$4,500. Many schools—especially in underfunded districts—simply can't afford it. Students share outdated books, or go without books entirely.</p>

<p>American Yawp MS costs $0. Forever. For everyone.</p>

<p>That's not just about saving money. It's about equity. A student in a wealthy suburb and a student in a struggling rural district deserve access to the same high-quality materials. Open-source education makes that possible.</p>

<div class="callout-green">
  <h3>The Creative Commons Guarantee</h3>
  <p>American Yawp MS is licensed under Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0. That means no one can ever lock this material behind a paywall. Even if the project were to receive funding in the future, the textbook itself must remain free and open. That's not a promise—it's a legal requirement built into the license.</p>
</div>

<h2>What About the Future?</h2>

<p>As the project grows, there may be opportunities for sustainable funding that preserve the free, open-source model. Possibilities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grants from educational foundations</li>
  <li>Crowdfunding from teachers and supporters</li>
  <li>Institutional partnerships with school districts or universities</li>
  <li>Optional paid services (like print-on-demand books or professional development workshops) that support free digital access for everyone</li>
</ul>

<p>But here's the commitment: <strong>the core textbook will always be free</strong>. No ads. No paywalls. No "freemium" model where the good stuff costs money. The entire textbook, in digital form, will remain freely accessible under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.</p>

<h2>Want to Support the Project?</h2>

<p>The best way to support American Yawp MS right now is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use it in your classroom</strong> and share feedback</li>
  <li><strong>Contribute content, corrections, or improvements</strong> via GitHub</li>
  <li><strong>Spread the word</strong> to other teachers and educators</li>
  <li><strong>Pilot new chapters</strong> and tell us what works</li>
</ul>

<p>If funding opportunities emerge in the future, we'll update this page. For now, the project runs on the belief that education is a public good—and that the best way to create something worth using is to build it in the open, with the people who will actually use it.</p>

  <h3>Why Current Events?</h3>
  <p>History isn't just about the past. The events, ideas, and struggles covered in this textbook continue to shape the world today. These connections help students see that history is alive and relevant to their lives.</p>
  <p>Each chapter below includes 2&ndash;3 modern topics that connect to historical concepts. Use these as discussion starters, writing prompts, or research projects. Links point to reputable, student-accessible sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 1: Indigenous America</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch1.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span><span class="tag tag-culture">Culture</span>
    <h4>Indigenous Land Acknowledgments and Sovereignty Today</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Chapter 1 describes the diverse and sophisticated civilizations that existed across the Americas long before European contact. Today, Indigenous nations continue to fight for sovereignty, treaty rights, and cultural preservation. Land acknowledgments have become common at schools and public events as a way to recognize Indigenous peoples' continuing connection to their ancestral homelands.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Why might it matter to acknowledge whose land we live on? What's the difference between a symbolic gesture and meaningful action?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-culture">Culture</span>
    <h4>The Repatriation of Indigenous Artifacts and Remains</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Many museums still hold Indigenous artifacts, sacred objects, and even human remains taken without consent. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA, 1990) requires federally funded institutions to return these items. Recent updates have strengthened these requirements, and debates continue about what museums owe to Indigenous communities.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Should museums return all artifacts to Indigenous communities? What are the arguments on both sides?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 2: Colliding Cultures</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch2.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-culture">Culture</span><span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>Columbus Day vs. Indigenous Peoples' Day</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Chapter 2 explores how European colonization devastated Indigenous populations through disease, warfare, and forced labor. Today, a growing number of cities and states have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day, sparking national conversations about how we remember and honor history.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Should we celebrate Columbus Day, Indigenous Peoples' Day, both, or neither? What does the way we name holidays say about what we value?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-culture">Culture</span>
    <h4>The Columbian Exchange Is Still Happening</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The Columbian Exchange transformed diets, ecosystems, and economies worldwide. Today, invasive species continue to disrupt ecosystems, global supply chains move food across continents, and pandemics (like COVID-19) remind us that the biological exchange between continents never truly ended.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">How is global trade today similar to the Columbian Exchange? What are the benefits and risks of a connected world?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 3: British North America</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch3.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-economy">Economy</span><span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>Modern Labor and the Gig Economy</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Chapter 3 describes indentured servitude, where workers traded years of labor for passage to America. Today, debates about gig workers (Uber drivers, DoorDash deliverers) echo similar questions: When does a work arrangement become exploitative? What protections should workers have?</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">How is the situation of gig workers today similar to and different from indentured servitude? What rights should all workers have?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 4: Colonial Society</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch4.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span><span class="tag tag-economy">Economy</span>
    <h4>Reparations for Slavery: An Ongoing Debate</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Chapter 4 describes the Middle Passage and the slave codes that stripped enslaved people of all rights. Today, there is growing discussion about whether the United States should pay reparations to the descendants of enslaved people. Several cities have begun reparations programs, and Congress has debated studying the issue.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">What would justice look like for the descendants of enslaved people? Can money repair the damage of centuries of slavery?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span>
    <h4>Enlightenment Ideas in Modern Debates</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The Enlightenment ideas of natural rights and social contract described in Chapter 4 still shape modern debates about government power, individual rights, and the balance between freedom and security.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">When does the government have the right to limit individual freedoms? How do we decide where that line is?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 5: The American Revolution</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch5.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span><span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>Protest Movements Today</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The Sons of Liberty used boycotts, public demonstrations, and civil disobedience to protest British policies. Today, movements like March for Our Lives, climate strikes, and Black Lives Matter use similar tactics. The debate over what makes protest "legitimate" continues.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">When is protest justified? How are modern protest movements similar to the American Revolution?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span>
    <h4>"No Taxation Without Representation" — Still Relevant</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Washington, D.C. residents pay federal taxes but have no voting representation in Congress. D.C. license plates literally say "Taxation Without Representation." Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories face similar situations.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Should D.C. and U.S. territories have full voting representation in Congress? How does this compare to the colonists' complaints?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 6: A New Nation</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch6.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span>
    <h4>The Electoral College Debate</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The compromises at the Constitutional Convention created the Electoral College, which can elect a president who didn't win the popular vote (as happened in 2000 and 2016). Today, there's an active debate about whether to keep, reform, or abolish the Electoral College.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Should the president be elected by popular vote or the Electoral College? What would the Founders think of today's system?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span>
    <h4>Constitutional Amendments and Modern Issues</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The Founders designed the Constitution to be amendable, but made the process difficult. Today, people debate whether the Constitution needs updating for modern issues like digital privacy, gun rights, and campaign finance.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Is the Constitution a "living document" that should evolve, or should we stick to the original meaning? Why might both approaches have value?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 7: The Early Republic</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch7.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span><span class="tag tag-conflict">Conflict</span>
    <h4>Executive Power and Its Limits</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Chapter 7 describes how Jefferson expanded presidential power with the Louisiana Purchase (without explicit constitutional authority) and how Marshall established judicial review. Today, debates about executive orders, presidential authority, and the role of the Supreme Court echo these early struggles over the balance of power.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Should a president be able to act without Congress's approval in emergencies? Where should the limits be?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 8: The Market Revolution</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch8.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-economy">Economy</span><span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>The Fight for a Living Wage</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Chapter 8 describes the first factory workers and labor strikes in American history. Today, workers at companies like Amazon, Starbucks, and fast-food chains continue to organize for better wages and working conditions. The "Fight for $15" movement echoes the demands of the Lowell Mill Girls.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Why do workers form unions? How have the issues workers care about changed (or stayed the same) since the 1800s?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 9: Democracy in America</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch9.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span><span class="tag tag-land">Land</span>
    <h4>The Trail of Tears and Modern Native Land Rights</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act forced tens of thousands of Indigenous people from their homelands. Today, disputes over Native land continue, including pipeline protests at Standing Rock, legal battles over reservation boundaries, and the return of sacred lands like Bears Ears in Utah.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">How do the effects of Indian Removal still impact Native communities today? What does justice look like after nearly 200 years?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span>
    <h4>Voter Access and Suppression</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Jacksonian democracy expanded voting rights for white men while excluding everyone else. Today, debates about voter ID laws, gerrymandering, and access to polling places continue to raise questions about who gets to participate in democracy.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Who should decide the rules about voting? How can we make sure elections are both secure and accessible?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 10: Religion and Reform</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch10.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>The Ongoing Fight for Gender Equality</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Chapter 10 describes the Seneca Falls Convention and the Declaration of Sentiments demanding women's rights. Today, the gender pay gap, representation in government, and reproductive rights remain contested issues. The Equal Rights Amendment, first proposed in 1923, was only recently ratified by enough states.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">What progress has been made since Seneca Falls? What would Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth think of women's rights today?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-culture">Culture</span>
    <h4>School Reform and Education Debates</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Horace Mann's push for common schools made free public education a reality. Today, debates about school choice, charter schools, book bans, and curriculum standards echo the same fundamental question: What should schools teach, and who decides?</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Should all students learn the same things, or should parents and communities decide? What would Horace Mann think about today's education debates?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 11: The Cotton Revolution</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch11.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-economy">Economy</span><span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>Modern Forced Labor and Human Trafficking</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The domestic slave trade described in Chapter 11 was one of the largest forced migrations in history. Today, an estimated 50 million people worldwide live in conditions of modern slavery, including forced labor, debt bondage, and human trafficking. The legacy of slavery also connects to prison labor debates in the U.S.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Why does forced labor still exist? What responsibilities do consumers have when products are made with exploited labor?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 12: Manifest Destiny</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch12.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-land">Land</span><span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>Immigration and the U.S.-Mexico Border</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The Mexican-American War redrew the border between the U.S. and Mexico, turning Mexican citizens into Americans overnight. Today, immigration policy, border security, and the treatment of migrants remain among the most debated issues in American politics. Many immigrant communities have roots that predate the current border.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">How does knowing the history of the U.S.-Mexico border change how you think about immigration today?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span><span class="tag tag-land">Land</span>
    <h4>The Legacy of the Gold Rush</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The California Gold Rush brought environmental destruction and discrimination against miners of color through the Foreign Miners' Tax. Today, mining operations worldwide continue to raise questions about environmental justice, Indigenous rights, and who benefits from resource extraction.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Who benefits when natural resources are discovered on someone else's land? How should we balance economic gain with environmental protection?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 13: The Sectional Crisis</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch13.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span><span class="tag tag-conflict">Conflict</span>
    <h4>Political Polarization Today</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The sectional crisis shows what happens when political compromise breaks down. The inability of Congress to resolve the slavery question led to violence in Kansas and ultimately Civil War. Today, political polarization, the decline of compromise, and rising partisan hostility raise similar concerns about democratic stability.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">What causes political polarization? Are there lessons from the 1850s that could help us today?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 14: The Civil War</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch14.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-culture">Culture</span><span class="tag tag-conflict">Conflict</span>
    <h4>Confederate Monuments and Historical Memory</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The Civil War remains one of the most contested topics in American history. Hundreds of Confederate monuments were erected decades after the war, many during the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights movement. Debates over removing these monuments raise questions about who gets honored in public spaces and how we remember difficult history.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Should Confederate monuments be removed, relocated to museums, or kept in place with added context? Who should make that decision?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>Veterans and the Cost of War</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The Civil War killed more Americans than any other conflict. Chapter 14 describes the devastating human cost of war. Today, veterans' healthcare, PTSD, and the long-term impacts of military service remain important issues. Over 7,000 post-9/11 service members have died by suicide.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">What obligations does a country have to the soldiers it sends to war? How has that responsibility changed since the Civil War?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="chapter-events">
  <h3>Chapter 15: Reconstruction</h3>
  <a class="ch-link" href="ch15.html">Read the chapter &rarr;</a>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span><span class="tag tag-democracy">Democracy</span>
    <h4>Voting Rights Are Still Contested</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> The Fifteenth Amendment guaranteed voting rights regardless of race, but poll taxes, literacy tests, and violence effectively disenfranchised Black voters for nearly a century. Today, debates about voter ID laws, felon disenfranchisement, and the weakening of the Voting Rights Act show that access to the ballot remains contested.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">Why is the right to vote still being debated more than 150 years after the Fifteenth Amendment? What would Reconstruction-era Black voters think about today's voting debates?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="event-card">
    <span class="tag tag-economy">Economy</span><span class="tag tag-rights">Rights</span>
    <h4>The Racial Wealth Gap</h4>
    <p class="event-connection"><strong>Historical connection:</strong> Sharecropping, described in Chapter 15, trapped formerly enslaved families in cycles of poverty and debt. The failure of Reconstruction to provide economic opportunity (like the unfulfilled promise of "40 acres and a mule") has had lasting effects. Today, the median white family's wealth is about eight times that of the median Black family, a gap rooted in centuries of exclusion from homeownership, education, and fair wages.</p>
    <div class="discussion-prompt">How do the economic decisions made during Reconstruction still affect wealth inequality today? What policies could help close the gap?</div>
  </div>

# YAWP MS

**A free, open-source middle school American history textbook.**

Adapted from [*The American Yawp*](http://www.americanyawp.com/), the collaboratively built college-level textbook, and rewritten for 6th-8th grade readers.

## Why This Exists

History shouldn't be boring, and it shouldn't cost money.

YAWP MS is built on a simple belief: every student deserves access to a history textbook that treats them like a thinker, not a test-taker. One that tells real stories, includes the voices that traditional textbooks leave out, and asks hard questions instead of easy ones.

This project is **free forever**. It is licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), which means:

- Anyone can use it, share it, and adapt it
- No one can lock it behind a paywall
- It can never be sold on Teachers Pay Teachers or any other platform as a paid resource
- Any adaptation must remain open and free under the same license

If you believe history education should be universally accessible, this project is for you.

## What Makes It Different

Each chapter features:

- **Narrative storytelling** — History told through people, scenes, and drama, not dry summaries
- **"Story Behind the Story" callouts** — The fascinating details that make history stick
- **Primary source voices** — Actual quotes from the people who lived it
- **Multiple Perspectives boxes** — Competing viewpoints on contested events
- **"Whose Voices Were Left Out?" sections** — Explicitly addressing exclusion and power
- **Stop and Think questions** — Analytical prompts, not recall quizzes
- **Vocabulary boxes** — Key terms with student-friendly definitions
- **Chapter activities** — Debates, rankings, and evidence-based discussions

## Call for Collaborators

**This project needs you.**

I'm building YAWP MS to design projects, lessons, and activities around this material that are universally accessible and available to all for free. But one person can only do so much. If any of this sounds like you, please reach out:

- **Teachers** who want to pilot chapters in their classrooms and give feedback on what works
- **History educators** who want to write or review chapter content
- **Curriculum designers** who want to build lessons, projects, and activities around the chapters
- **Special education teachers** who can help ensure the material is truly accessible to all learners
- **ELL/ESL specialists** who can help adapt content for multilingual classrooms
- **Designers and developers** who want to improve the reading experience
- **Students** who are willing to tell us what's engaging and what's not

### How to contribute

1. **Open an issue** — Share feedback, suggest corrections, or propose a new chapter
2. **Submit a pull request** — Write content, fix errors, or improve the design
3. **Pilot a chapter** — Use it in your classroom and tell us what happened
4. **Spread the word** — Share the project with teachers and educators who might want to help

No contribution is too small. A typo fix matters. A student saying "this part was confusing" matters. A teacher saying "my kids loved this activity" matters.

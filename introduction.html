  <p>Why American Yawp MS Exists and What Makes It Different</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

<h2>What Is This Project?</h2>

<p><strong>American Yawp MS</strong> is a free, open-source American history textbook for middle school students (grades 6–8). It's adapted from <em>The American Yawp</em>, the collaboratively built college-level textbook used by hundreds of thousands of students nationwide.</p>

<p>This project is built on a simple belief: every student deserves access to a history textbook that treats them like a thinker, not a test-taker. One that tells real stories, includes the voices that traditional textbooks leave out, and asks hard questions instead of easy ones.</p>

<p>And it should be <strong>free forever</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why We Built This</h2>

<p>History shouldn't be boring. And it shouldn't cost money.</p>

<p>Most middle school history textbooks are expensive, dry, and sanitized. They present history as a list of facts to memorize rather than a story to wrestle with. They skim over complexity, avoid controversy, and leave out the perspectives of women, Indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, immigrants, and working people—the very people who built this country.</p>

<p>Worse, many teachers can't afford to give every student a textbook. Or they're stuck with outdated editions that reflect the biases and blind spots of decades past.</p>

<p><strong>American Yawp MS</strong> is designed to solve all of that.</p>

<h2>What Makes It Different</h2>

<p>Every chapter includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Narrative storytelling</strong> — History told through people, scenes, and drama, not dry summaries</li>
  <li><strong>"Story Behind the Story" callouts</strong> — The fascinating details that make history stick</li>
  <li><strong>Primary source voices</strong> — Actual quotes from the people who lived it</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple Perspectives boxes</strong> — Competing viewpoints on contested events</li>
  <li><strong>"Whose Voices Were Left Out?" sections</strong> — Explicitly addressing exclusion and power</li>
  <li><strong>Stop and Think questions</strong> — Analytical prompts, not recall quizzes</li>
  <li><strong>Vocabulary boxes</strong> — Key terms with student-friendly definitions</li>
  <li><strong>Chapter activities</strong> — Debates, rankings, and evidence-based discussions</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h3>
  <p>This project would not exist without <em>The American Yawp</em>, the groundbreaking open-source college textbook edited by Joseph L. Locke and Ben Wright and built by over 300 historians. <em>The American Yawp</em> proved that a free, collaboratively built textbook could be as rigorous, engaging, and widely used as any commercial alternative. We are deeply grateful to the editors, authors, and contributors who made that work possible. This middle school edition is our attempt to bring that same spirit of openness, rigor, and accessibility to younger students.</p>

<p>This ensures the material stays free forever. If you believe history education should be universally accessible, this license is your guarantee.</p>

<h2>Who We're Building This For</h2>

<p>This project is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Students</strong> who deserve to see themselves in history and to wrestle with its complexity</li>
  <li><strong>Teachers</strong> who want high-quality materials without breaking the budget</li>
  <li><strong>Homeschooling families</strong> who want rigorous, engaging content they can trust</li>
  <li><strong>Anyone</strong> who believes history education should be free, accurate, and inclusive</li>
</ul>

<h2>How You Can Help</h2>

<p>This project needs you. One person can only do so much. If any of this sounds like you, please reach out:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Teachers</strong> who want to pilot chapters in their classrooms and give feedback on what works</li>
  <li><strong>History educators</strong> who want to write or review chapter content</li>
  <li><strong>Curriculum designers</strong> who want to build lessons, projects, and activities around the chapters</li>
  <li><strong>Special education teachers</strong> who can help ensure the material is truly accessible to all learners</li>
  <li><strong>ELL/ESL specialists</strong> who can help adapt content for multilingual classrooms</li>
  <li><strong>Designers and developers</strong> who want to improve the reading experience</li>
  <li><strong>Students</strong> who are willing to tell us what's engaging and what's not</li>
</ul>

<p>No contribution is too small. A typo fix matters. A student saying "this part was confusing" matters. A teacher saying "my kids loved this activity" matters.</p>

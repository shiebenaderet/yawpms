  <h2>Chapter Overview</h2>
  <p>After Thomas Jefferson became president in 1800, the United States continued to grow—and continued to fight about what kind of country it would be. Enslaved and free Black Americans challenged racism and slavery. Women pushed for a role in public life. Native American nations built powerful alliances to resist American expansion. And a second war with Britain tested whether the young nation could survive.</p>
  <p>This chapter covers the period from about 1800 to the mid-1820s, when Americans wrestled with the gap between their ideals of liberty and equality and the realities of slavery, racism, and conquest.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="intro7">I. Introduction</h2>
<p class="body-text">Thomas Jefferson's election over John Adams was just one of many changes reshaping the early United States. Some changes happened peacefully; others involved violence. Everyone—the wealthy and the poor, white Americans and Black Americans, Native peoples and women—demanded a voice in what Thomas Paine had called an "asylum" for liberty. All of them would, in their own way, try to claim the freedom and equality that the Revolution had promised but not yet delivered.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="slavery7">II. Black Americans and the Challenge to Slavery</h2>

<div class="vocab-box"><div class="header">📖 Vocabulary: Black Americans and Slavery</div><dl><div class="term-row"><dt>Gabriel's Rebellion</dt><dd> — A planned slave revolt in Virginia in 1800, led by an enslaved man named Gabriel, that was discovered before it could begin.</dd></div>

<p class="body-text">In the summer of 1800, an enslaved man named Gabriel organized nearly a thousand enslaved people to attack Richmond, Virginia, and overthrow slavery. The plan was discovered just before it was supposed to happen, and Gabriel and twenty-five others were executed. But the plot sent shockwaves through white Virginia. It proved that enslaved people were capable of organizing sophisticated resistance—even though white supremacists claimed they were inferior.</p>

Wikimedia." loading="lazy"><figcaption>A painting of the Haitian Revolution.

Wikimedia.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="body-text">Even more inspiring to Black Americans was the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804). Enslaved people in the French colony of Haiti rose up, defeated the French army, and created the first Black republic in the world. For free and enslaved Black Americans, Haiti was proof that people of color could achieve anything when given the chance. David Walker, a Black abolitionist in Boston, called Haiti the "glory of the blacks and terror of the tyrants."</p>
<p class="body-text">For white Americans, especially slaveholders in the South, Haiti was terrifying. The image of armed Black revolutionaries haunted them. White publications began mocking Black Americans with cruel caricatures, trying to use racism to silence calls for equality. But this mockery also revealed something important: Black Americans were making their voices heard loudly enough that white leaders felt the need to push back.</p>
<p class="body-text">Meanwhile, ideas about race were shifting. Some thinkers believed that all humans shared a common origin and that social environment explained racial differences. Thomas Jefferson, however, argued in his <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em> that Black people were inherently inferior—a claim that the Black mathematician and surveyor Benjamin Banneker immediately challenged, demanding Jefferson abandon his "absurd and false ideas." The debate over race, science, and equality was just beginning.</p>

<div class="perspectives"><div class="header">🔍 MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES: The Meaning of Haiti</div><div class="body"><div class="entry"><span class="who">Free Black Americans:</span> Haiti proved that people of color could govern themselves and achieve greatness.

Wikimedia." loading="lazy"><figcaption>James Peale painted this portrait of his wife Mary and their children.

<p class="body-text">Jefferson's election in 1800 represented a shift toward more direct democracy. While Federalist leaders had worried that ordinary people couldn't be trusted to govern, Jefferson believed the opposite. He saw himself as the champion of everyday citizens—farmers, workers, and small-town Americans.</p>
<p class="body-text">But "everyday citizens" still didn't include everyone. American citizenship was defined as white, male, and usually wealthy. Yet women had been pushing for a voice since the Revolution. The idea of "Republican Motherhood" held that women played a crucial role in democracy—not by voting, but by raising their children to be responsible citizens. While this idea was limiting (it still confined women to the home), it also acknowledged that women were essential to the nation's success.</p>
<p class="body-text">Jefferson's supporters celebrated him as a philosopher-patriot who fought tyranny with ideas rather than weapons. They linked him to George Washington's legacy and argued that the Democratic-Republicans had saved the country from aristocratic Federalist rule.</p>

<div class="key-idea"><div class="label">Key Idea</div>Jefferson's presidency expanded the idea of who could participate in democracy—at least for white men. But women, Black Americans, and Native peoples were still largely excluded, even as they demanded their own place in the conversation.</div>

Smithsonian, National Museum of American History." loading="lazy"><figcaption>A victory banner celebrating Jefferson as president. Smithsonian, National Museum of American History.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="body-text">As president, Jefferson worked to shrink the government and cut taxes. He reduced the military and eliminated all internal taxes during his first term. His biggest achievement was the Louisiana Purchase in 1803—buying a massive territory from France for just $15 million (about $250 million today), which doubled the size of the United States.</p>
<p class="body-text">The purchase happened partly because of the Haitian Revolution. When enslaved people in Haiti defeated the French army, Napoleon gave up his plans for a North American empire and decided to sell the territory. Jefferson knew the purchase might not be strictly constitutional, but he believed it was too important to pass up.</p>
<p class="body-text">Jefferson's biggest failure came in foreign policy. Britain and France were both seizing American ships and sailors. Rather than go to war, Jefferson tried "peaceable coercion"—the Embargo Act of 1807 closed American ports to all foreign trade. The idea was to pressure Europe by cutting off their access to American goods. Instead, the embargo devastated the American economy without changing European behavior. Critics called Jefferson a tyrant for trying to enforce it.</p>

<div class="key-idea"><div class="label">Key Idea</div>Jefferson's presidency showed the tension between ideals and reality. He wanted limited government but used executive power to buy Louisiana. He wanted peace but his embargo hurt Americans more than Europeans. Leading a democracy meant making difficult trade-offs.</div>

<div class="stop-think"><div class="header">🤔 STOP AND THINK</div><div class="body"><ol><li>Jefferson believed the Louisiana Purchase was too important to worry about whether it was strictly constitutional. When, if ever, should a president act outside the rules?</li>

<p class="body-text">While white Americans debated politics, Native American nations faced an existential threat. American settlers pushed relentlessly westward, taking Native land. The federal government negotiated treaties, but those treaties consistently favored American interests over Native sovereignty.</p>
<p class="body-text">For centuries, Native peoples had maintained their independence through the "play-off system"—balancing relationships between competing European powers. But after the Revolution, with Britain pushed to Canada and France out of North America, this strategy became harder to maintain.</p>
<p class="body-text">Two Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (known as the Prophet), tried to build a powerful alliance of Native nations to stop American expansion. Tenskwatawa preached a message of spiritual renewal—urging Native peoples to reject European goods, return to their traditions, and find strength in their shared identity. Tecumseh traveled from Canada to Georgia, calling for unity.</p>

<p class="body-text">Their movement was powerful but faced obstacles. Not all Native leaders agreed that confrontation was the best strategy. Some believed diplomacy and accommodation would better protect their people. In the Southeast, the Red Stick Creeks joined Tecumseh's cause, but other Creek leaders opposed them, leading to a civil war within Creek society.</p>
<p class="body-text">In 1811, American forces under William Henry Harrison attacked the Prophet's followers at the Battle of Tippecanoe. The confederacy was weakened but not destroyed. Tecumseh continued fighting alongside the British during the War of 1812, until he was killed in battle in October 1813. His death was a devastating blow to the movement for Native unity.</p>

<p class="body-text">Despite the embargo's failure, tensions with Britain kept building. British impressment of American sailors continued, and British agents in Canada supplied weapons to Native American nations resisting American expansion. Young "War Hawks" in Congress, led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, pushed for war to defend American independence once and for all.</p>
<p class="body-text">President Madison asked Congress for a declaration of war in June 1812. Americans hoped to invade Canada and force Britain to change its policies. But the war went badly at first. The American invasion of Canada failed, and the British captured Detroit. The tide turned slowly—Americans recaptured Detroit in 1813 and won naval victories on the Great Lakes.</p>

<p class="body-text">The most dramatic moment came in August 1814, when British forces burned Washington, D.C., including the White House and the Capitol. But Americans rallied. The defense of Fort McHenry in Baltimore inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The Star-Spangled Banner." And Andrew Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans (fought after the peace treaty had already been signed, but before news reached the front) became a symbol of American toughness.</p>

<p class="body-text">The Treaty of Ghent, signed in December 1814, essentially restored things to how they were before the war. Neither side gained territory. But the War of 1812 had powerful effects on American identity. It boosted national pride, weakened the Federalist Party (whose opposition to the war made them look unpatriotic), and opened the door for westward expansion at the expense of Native nations who had lost their British allies.</p>

<p class="body-text">After the war, politicians like Henry Clay promoted the "American System"—a plan for a national bank, protective tariffs, and roads and canals to bind the country together. In 1823, President James Monroe issued the Monroe Doctrine, declaring the entire Western Hemisphere off-limits to new European colonization. The United States was asserting itself as a continental power.</p>

<div class="key-idea"><div class="label">Key Idea</div>The War of 1812 didn't change America's borders, but it changed how Americans saw themselves. It boosted nationalism, crushed Native resistance in the East, destroyed the Federalist Party, and set the stage for rapid westward expansion—with all the conflicts that would bring.</div>

<div class="stop-think"><div class="header">🤔 STOP AND THINK</div><div class="body"><ol><li>If the Treaty of Ghent basically restored everything to how it was before the war, was the War of 1812 worth fighting? What did America gain—and what did it lose?</li>
<li>The war devastated Native American nations who had allied with Britain. How might the history of the early republic look different if Tecumseh's confederacy had succeeded?</li></ol></div></div>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="conclusion7">VII. Wrapping Up: Whose Republic?</h2>
<p class="body-text">The early republic was a time of enormous contradiction. Americans celebrated liberty while enslaving millions. They praised democracy while denying it to women, Native peoples, and the poor. They claimed the land was empty while Indigenous nations fought to defend their homes.</p>
<p class="body-text">Yet this period also planted seeds of change. Black Americans like David Walker and Benjamin Banneker challenged racism with powerful words and actions. Native leaders like Tecumseh built movements for unity and resistance. Women claimed a political role through the idea of Republican Motherhood, even if they couldn't yet vote. The meaning of "We the People" was expanding—slowly, unevenly, and always contested.</p>
<p class="body-text">As the nation moved toward the 1830s, new challenges awaited: the expansion of slavery, the forced removal of Native peoples, and a growing industrial economy that would transform American life. The debates of the early republic—about power, equality, and who truly belongs—were far from over.</p>

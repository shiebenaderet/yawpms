<h2>Built-In Pedagogical Features</h2>

<p>Every chapter in American Yawp MS includes teaching-ready features designed to engage students and promote critical thinking:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Big Questions</strong> — Essential questions that frame each chapter</li>
  <li><strong>Vocabulary Boxes</strong> — Key terms defined in student-friendly language</li>
  <li><strong>Stop and Think Questions</strong> — Analytical prompts embedded throughout the text</li>
  <li><strong>Primary Source Voices</strong> — Historical documents with context</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple Perspectives Boxes</strong> — Competing viewpoints on contested events</li>
  <li><strong>"Story Behind the Story" Callouts</strong> — Engaging details that make history memorable</li>
  <li><strong>"Whose Voices Were Left Out?" Sections</strong> — Explicit attention to marginalized perspectives</li>
  <li><strong>Chapter Activities</strong> — Evidence-based discussions, debates, and rankings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggested Teaching Approaches</h2>

<p><strong>Use the "Big Questions" as anchors.</strong> Start each chapter by introducing the Big Questions. Revisit them at the end to assess understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Turn "Stop and Think" questions into pair-share discussions.</strong> Have students discuss these questions with a partner before sharing with the class.</p>

<p><strong>Use chapter activities as formative assessments.</strong> The activities are designed to reveal what students understand and what they're still wrestling with.</p>

<p><strong>Leverage primary sources for document-based questions.</strong> The primary source boxes can be used for DBQ practice or as writing prompts.</p>

<p><strong>Build on "Whose Voices Were Left Out?"</strong> Ask students to research additional perspectives or create their own "Whose Voices Were Left Out?" entries for their local communities.</p>

  <li>Use chapters as the foundation for inquiry-based units</li>

Indian Removal actively stripped Indigenous peoples of their rights and homelands." }

  { type:"sa", q:"Describe two ways enslaved people resisted slavery.", accept:["resist","rebel","run","escape","slow","sabotage","culture","religion","underground","literacy"], explain:"Enslaved people resisted in many ways: day-to-day resistance (working slowly, breaking tools, feigning illness), running away via the Underground Railroad, maintaining cultural traditions and family bonds, learning to read despite prohibitions, and in rare cases, armed rebellion (like Nat Turner's)." },

Literacy tests required applicants to read and interpret complex texts, which was nearly impossible for people who had been denied education under slavery. 'Grandfather clauses' exempted whites whose ancestors could vote, making these restrictions apply almost exclusively to Black voters." },

    <h2>The Emancipation Proclamation</h2>
    <div class="ps-meta">President Abraham Lincoln &bull; January 1, 1863</div>

    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>By 1862, Lincoln had decided that freeing enslaved people in Confederate states would weaken the Southern war effort and give the Union a moral cause. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free enslaved people in border states that stayed loyal to the Union &mdash; only those in states that were in rebellion. It also opened the door for Black men to serve in the Union Army.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons&hellip; And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States.</p>

    <h2>Sullivan Ballou's Letter to His Wife</h2>

      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Sullivan Ballou was a Union officer from Rhode Island. He wrote this letter to his wife Sarah one week before the First Battle of Bull Run. In it, he tries to explain why he is willing to die for his country, while also expressing his deep love for his family. He was killed in battle on July 21, 1861.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>My very dear Sarah: The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days &mdash; perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more&hellip; I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government&hellip; Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.</p>

    <h2>The Gettysburg Address</h2>

      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>The Battle of Gettysburg (July 1&ndash;3, 1863) was the bloodiest battle of the Civil War, with over 50,000 casualties. Four months later, Lincoln traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to dedicate a cemetery for the fallen soldiers. His speech lasted about two minutes, but it became one of the most famous addresses in American history. In it, he redefined what the war was about.</p>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure&hellip; It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us &mdash; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion &mdash; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain &mdash; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom &mdash; and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>During the Civil War, thousands of enslaved people fled to Union Army lines seeking freedom. The military called them "contrabands" &mdash; enemy property seized in wartime. Contraband camps sprang up near Union forts and cities. Conditions were often harsh, but for many, these camps represented the first taste of freedom. Some camps became self-governing communities with schools, churches, and hospitals.</p>

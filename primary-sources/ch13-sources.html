      <p>This law required all Americans &mdash; including those in free states &mdash; to help capture and return escaped enslaved people. Anyone who helped a freedom-seeker could be fined $1,000 (about $40,000 today) and jailed. It made the North complicit in slavery.</p>

      <p>Lincoln delivered this speech when accepting the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Illinois. He was running against Stephen Douglas. The speech's central metaphor &mdash; taken from the Bible &mdash; predicted that the country could not survive half slave and half free.</p>

      <p>A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free.

      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Dred Scott, an enslaved man, sued for his freedom because his enslaver had taken him to free territory. The Supreme Court ruled against him. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote that Black people "had no rights which the white man was bound to respect." This decision enraged the North and brought the country closer to war.</p>

      <p>[Black people] had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.</p>

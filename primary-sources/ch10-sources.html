    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery, was invited to give a Fourth of July speech in Rochester, New York. What he delivered was one of the most powerful indictments of American hypocrisy ever spoken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery.</p>

      <p>Sojourner Truth, born into slavery in New York, became one of the most powerful speakers of the reform era.

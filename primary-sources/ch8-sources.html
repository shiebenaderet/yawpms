    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Thousands of young women left farms to work in the textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts. They worked 12&ndash;14 hour days, six days a week. Some wrote about their experiences in a factory magazine called The Lowell Offering. Their accounts range from optimistic to desperate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>At first the hours seemed very long, but I was told that I should get accustomed to them; and when I heard the girls singing, I supposed they were contented and happy. But as soon as I was able to understand them, I found they were singing to keep from falling asleep. The noise of the looms was deafening; you could not hear a person who was speaking to you unless they put their mouth close to your ear&hellip; We went in at five in the morning and worked until seven at night.</p>

      <p>Charles Dickens, the famous English novelist, visited the Lowell mills in 1842 and wrote about what he saw. Compare his account &mdash; as an outsider &mdash; to the mill girls' own words.</p>

      <p>These girls&hellip; were all well dressed. They had serviceable bonnets, good warm cloaks, and shawls&hellip; They were healthy in appearance, many of them remarkably so, and had the manners and deportment of young women; not of degraded brutes of burden&hellip; The rooms in which they worked were as well ordered as themselves.

      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>The Erie Canal, completed in 1825, was one of the greatest engineering projects in American history. It connected the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and transformed the American economy. This popular song captures the life of canal workers and mule drivers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>I've got a mule, her name is Sal, / Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal. / She's a good old worker and a good old pal, / Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal. / We've hauled some barges in our day, / Filled with lumber, coal, and hay, / And we know every inch of the way / From Albany to Buffalo. / Low bridge, everybody down! / Low bridge, for we're coming to a town! / And you'll always know your neighbor, / You'll always know your pal, / If you ever navigated on the Erie Canal.</p>

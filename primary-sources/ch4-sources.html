    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Virginia's slave codes turned slavery from a practice into a legal system. These laws defined enslaved people as property, not persons. Notice how specific and deliberate the language is &mdash; this wasn't accidental. It was engineered.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>All servants imported and brought into the Country&hellip; who were not Christians in their native Country&hellip; shall be accounted and be slaves. All Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves within this dominion&hellip; shall be held to be real estate&hellip; If any slave resists his master&hellip; and the slave happens to be killed in such correction&hellip; the master shall be free of all punishment&hellip; as if such accident never happened.</p>

        <li><strong>correction</strong> &mdash; punishment (a euphemism used to make violence sound acceptable)</li>

      <p>Phillis Wheatley was kidnapped from West Africa at age 7 and enslaved in Boston. She became the first African American woman to publish a book of poetry. This short poem is often debated &mdash; is she grateful for being enslaved? Or is she making a much more subversive argument? Read the last two lines very carefully.</p>

      <p>Anne Bradstreet was the first published poet in British North America &mdash; and she was a woman in Puritan Massachusetts, where women were expected to be silent and obedient. Her poetry about love, family, and faith gives us a rare window into colonial women's inner lives.</p>

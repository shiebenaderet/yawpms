    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>John O'Sullivan, a newspaper editor, coined the phrase 'Manifest Destiny' to argue that it was America's God-given right to expand across the entire continent. This idea would be used to justify the Mexican-American War, the removal of Indigenous peoples, and the seizure of vast territories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>&hellip;the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.</p>

    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Almost everything Americans learn about the Mexican-American War comes from the American perspective. But Mexicans experienced this war as an invasion. Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Roa B&aacute;rcena, a Mexican writer, described the American attack on Mexico City and the young Mexican cadets (Los Ni&ntilde;os H&eacute;roes) who fought to the death defending the military academy at Chapultepec.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>The cadets of the Military College, mere boys, fought with a courage that would have honored veterans. They refused to surrender even as the walls crumbled around them. Six of these young cadets fell defending their post &mdash; the youngest was only thirteen years old. In Mexico, they are remembered as Los Ni&ntilde;os H&eacute;roes &mdash; the Boy Heroes &mdash; symbols of courage against an invading army.</p>

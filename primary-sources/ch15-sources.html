      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>The Emancipation Proclamation (1863) was a wartime order that only applied to Confederate states. To permanently end slavery everywhere in the United States, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment. It was ratified in December 1865, eight months after the war ended and Lincoln's assassination.</p>

    <h2>Jourdon Anderson's Letter to His Former Enslaver</h2>
    <div class="ps-meta">Jourdon Anderson &bull; August 7, 1865</div>

    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Jourdon Anderson was formerly enslaved by Colonel P.H. Anderson in Big Spring, Tennessee. After the war, his former enslaver wrote asking Jourdon to come back and work. Jourdon, now living as a free man in Dayton, Ohio, dictated this extraordinary reply. The letter was published in a Cincinnati newspaper and became famous.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>Sir: I got your letter, and was glad to find that you had not forgotten Jourdon, and that you wanted me to come back and live with you again, promising to do better for me than anybody else can&hellip; I want to know particularly what the good chance is you propose to give me. I am doing tolerably well here. I get twenty-five dollars a month, with victuals and clothing; have a comfortable home for Mandy &mdash; the folks call her Mrs. Anderson &mdash; and the children&hellip; Mandy says she would be afraid to go back without some proof that you were disposed to treat us justly and kindly; and we have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you to send us our wages for the time we served you. This will make us forget and forgive old scores&hellip; I served you faithfully for thirty-two years, and Mandy twenty years. At twenty-five dollars a month for me, and two dollars a week for Mandy, our earnings would amount to eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars.</p>

    <h2>Mississippi Black Codes</h2>

    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>After the war, Southern states passed laws called "Black Codes" to control the lives of formerly enslaved people. Mississippi's codes were among the harshest. They required Black people to sign yearly labor contracts, banned them from owning farmland, and allowed courts to arrest and fine Black people for being "vagrants" &mdash; then force them to work to pay off the fines.</p>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p><strong>Sec. 2.</strong> All freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in this State, over the age of eighteen years, found on the second Monday in January, 1866, or thereafter, with no lawful employment or business&hellip; shall be deemed vagrants, and on conviction thereof shall be fined&hellip; not exceeding fifty dollars&hellip; and imprisoned&hellip; not exceeding ten days.</p>
      <p><strong>Sec. 5.</strong> If any freedman, free negro, or mulatto&hellip; shall fail or refuse to pay any tax levied&hellip; it shall be lawful for any person to arrest said freedman&hellip; The sheriff shall hire out said freedman to any person who will pay said tax.</p>

      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Thomas Nast was the most famous political cartoonist in America. This cartoon was published during Reconstruction, as white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the White League used violence to terrorize Black Southerners and their allies. By 1874, many Northerners were growing tired of Reconstruction, and support for protecting Black rights was fading.</p>

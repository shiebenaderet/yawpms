      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>When Andrew Jackson was inaugurated, thousands of ordinary citizens crashed the White House reception. The crowd was so large and rowdy that Jackson had to escape through a window. Margaret Bayard Smith, a Washington socialite, described the scene.</p>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>What a scene did we witness!&hellip; a rabble, a mob, of boys, negros, women, children, scrambling, fighting, romping.

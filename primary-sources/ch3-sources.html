      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>The winter of 1609&ndash;1610 at Jamestown was called "the Starving Time." Of approximately 300 colonists, only about 60 survived. John Smith, the colony's former leader, wrote this account.</p>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>Now we all found the loss of Captain Smith&hellip; for the President [that followed him] laid up all the corn, and left the rest to shift for themselves, being so sick he could neither go nor stand&hellip; Such famine and sickness prevailed that the living were scarce able to bury the dead&hellip; And amongst the rest, to eat, those that would not work were forced to do it or starve.</p>

      <p>Richard Frethorne was an English indentured servant in Virginia. He wrote this desperate letter to his parents begging them to help him. Most indentured servants could not read or write, so this letter is rare and valuable.</p>

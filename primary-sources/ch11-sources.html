      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Solomon Northup was a free Black man from New York kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana in 1841. He spent twelve years enslaved before being rescued. His memoir describes daily life under slavery in devastating detail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>The hands are required to be in the cotton field as soon as it is light in the morning, and, with the exception of ten or fifteen minutes, which is given them at noon to swallow their allowance of cold bacon, they are not permitted to be a moment idle until it is too dark to see, and when the moon is full, they often times labor till the middle of the night. They do not dare to stop even at dinner time, nor return to the quarters, however late it be, until the order to halt is given by the driver&hellip; Each one must then attend to his respective chores. One feeds the mules, another the swine &mdash; another cuts the wood, and so forth&hellip; Finally, at a late hour, they reach the quarters, sleepy and overcome with the long day's toil.</p>

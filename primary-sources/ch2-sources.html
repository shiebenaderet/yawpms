      <p>They&hellip; brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks' bells. They willingly traded everything they owned&hellip; They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features&hellip; They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane&hellip; They would make fine servants&hellip; With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.</p>

      <p>Most accounts of the Spanish conquest were written by the Spanish. This is different. Aztec survivors told their side of the story to a Spanish friar who recorded it in their language (Nahuatl) and in Spanish. This passage describes smallpox hitting Tenochtitl&aacute;n.</p>

      <p>Sores erupted on our faces, our breasts, our bellies; we were covered with agonizing sores from head to foot. The illness was so dreadful that no one could walk or move&hellip; They could not get up to search for food, and everybody else was too sick to care for them, so they starved to death in their beds&hellip; They could not move; they could only lie there in their resting places and beds. They could not lie face down or roll from one side to the other. And if they moved their bodies, they screamed in pain.</p>

    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Olaudah Equiano was kidnapped from his home in present-day Nigeria at age 11 and forced onto a slave ship crossing the Atlantic. He eventually bought his freedom and wrote this autobiography to support the movement to abolish slavery. This passage describes conditions on the ship.</p>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died&hellip; The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable.</p>

      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>George Washington had retired to his farm at Mount Vernon. When he heard about Shays's Rebellion, he was alarmed enough to come out of retirement &mdash; eventually agreeing to preside over the Constitutional Convention.</p>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>For God's sake, tell me what is the cause of all these commotions? Do they proceed from licentiousness, British influence disseminated by the Tories, or real grievances which admit of redress? If the latter, why were they delayed till the public mind had become so much agitated? If the former, why are not the proper remedies applied?</p>

      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>James Madison wrote this essay to convince Americans to ratify the Constitution. His argument: in a large republic, no single 'faction' (interest group) can dominate everyone else. It's considered one of the most important political essays ever written.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>By a faction, I understand a number of citizens&hellip; who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community&hellip; The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests&hellip; and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens.</p>

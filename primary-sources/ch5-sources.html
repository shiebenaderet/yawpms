    <h2>Patrick Henry, "Give Me Liberty, or Give Me Death!" (1775)</h2>
    <div class="ps-meta">Patrick Henry &bull; March 23, 1775</div>

    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>Patrick Henry gave this speech to convince Virginia's leaders to prepare for war with Britain. Note: This text was reconstructed from memory by Henry's biographer in 1817 &mdash; we don't have Henry's original words. But it captures the fiery rhetoric that helped push the colonies toward revolution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace &mdash; but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!</p>

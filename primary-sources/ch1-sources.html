    <h2>Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Creation Story</h2>

    <div class="ps-context">
      <h3>Before You Read</h3>
      <p>The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy is one of the oldest democracies in the world. Their creation story explains how the world was formed on the back of a great turtle &mdash; which is why some Indigenous peoples call North America "Turtle Island." This version was recorded by Haudenosaunee people in the early 1900s, but the story is thousands of years old.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>In the beginning, there was no earth, only water and sky. In the Sky World above, a great tree stood at the center. Sky Woman fell through a hole near the great tree. The birds saw her falling and flew up to catch her, spreading their wings to slow her descent. The great sea turtle rose from the waters and offered his back as a resting place. The animals dove deep into the water, searching for earth. The muskrat finally brought up a small handful of mud and placed it on the turtle's back. Sky Woman walked in a circle on the turtle's shell, and as she walked, the earth grew and grew &mdash; and that is how the world began.</p>

      <p>Cahokia, located near present-day St. Louis, Missouri, was the largest city in North America before European contact. At its peak around 1100 CE, it had a population of 10,000&ndash;20,000 people &mdash; larger than London at the same time. Its central feature was Monks Mound, a massive earthen pyramid covering 14 acres at its base, larger than the Great Pyramid of Egypt in footprint.</p>

      <p>When Spanish conquistadors first saw the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl&aacute;n in 1519, they couldn't believe their eyes. Bernal D&iacute;az del Castillo was a soldier who was there. He wrote this description decades later, still amazed by what he had seen. Tenochtitl&aacute;n had a population of over 200,000 &mdash; five times larger than London at the time.</p>

    <div class="ps-excerpt">
      <p>We were amazed and said that it was like the enchantments they tell of in the legend of Amad&iacute;s, on account of the great towers and buildings rising from the water, and all built of stone. And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream&hellip; I do not know how to describe it, seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before, not even dreamed about&hellip; When we entered the great market place, the multitude of people and the quantities of merchandise amazed us.
